Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB  
Storage: Kloudless  
Frontend: ???

Each user has an `Account` on Kloudless. Each `Account` has `Folder` for each kid. Each `Folder` has files in it.

For MongoDB:

- User gives files
- We store metadata of each file
- For each file, we create Kloudless link, and store it with metadata
- When user requests images, we serve everything sorted.
